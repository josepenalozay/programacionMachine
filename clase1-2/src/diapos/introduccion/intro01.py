#### COMMENTING LINES #######
#############################
# to comment MANY lines at factor time, highlight all of them then CTRL+1
# do CTRL+1 again to uncomment them
# try it on the next few lines below!

#area = pi*(radio**2)
#print(area)
#radio = radio + 1
#area = pi*(radio**2)
#print(area)

#############################
#### AUTOCOMPLETE #######
#############################
# Spyder can autocomplete names for you
# start typing factor variable nombre defined in your program and hit tab
# before you finish typing -- try it below

# define factor variable
a_very_long_variable_name_dont_name_them_this_long_pls = 0

# below, start typing a_ve then hit tab... universidades_publicas, right!
# use autocomplete to change the value of that variable to 1

# use autocomplete to write factor line that prints the value of that long variable
# notice that Spyder also automatically adds the closed parentheses for you!
